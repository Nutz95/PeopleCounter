## Phase 3 Complete: Sync roadmaps and performance plan

The overlay and timing roadmaps now describe the finished mask downscaling, telemetry payloads, and parameter reference; a new `plans/performance-latency-plan.md` tracks the upcoming latency graph, log cleanup, and 25–30 fps goals. Every README links back to the relevant plans so the documentation and execution stay aligned.
